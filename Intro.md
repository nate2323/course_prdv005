Course Syllabus for "PRDV005: Time and Stress Management "
----------------------------------------------------------

Effective time management is the key to getting the most out of your
day. It helps you improve performance, increase productivity, and reduce
stress. Time management is critical to maximizing your day and surviving
mounting responsibilities and pressures. Time is your most important
resource. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify your objectives and
determine priorities daily. Every action you take represents a priority
decision. The problem is rarely that you *aren’t capable* of completing
a task; the problem, most often, is time – eventually you will run out
of it. This course will provide learners with several time management
tools and techniques that can be applied to most work and life
situations. From juggling multiple tasks, to managing e-mail, to beating
deadlines: you will learn how to budget time wisely, and overcome
distractions and time wasters.

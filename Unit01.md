**Unit 1: The Concept of Time Management** <span id="1"></span> 
*While none of us knows what our future holds, some of us take proactive
steps to explore possibilities and opportunities open to us.
Congratulations! You are beginning an exciting journey toward realizing
your goals. In order to use your time productively, you will first need
to learn more about yourself, your interests and personality, and how
these factors relate to various types of jobs or careers. This unit
offers resources to address this self-knowledge. For example, Saylor
Foundation’s introductory video, “The Importance of Self-Assessment,”
reinforces that the initial step in your journey needs to be
self-assessment. Secondly, you will have an opportunity to take Jung’s
Typology Test to assess your personality type. Finally, John Holland’s
quiz will help you to understand how your personality type is compatible
with various work environments. By learning more about yourself, you are
ensuring that your job search strategy is appropriate to your interests
and strengths. Enjoy your self-exploration!*

    of time management. This video was published in 2007. While some of
    the references may seem outdated, the concept of time management and
    technology is still relevant today. For example, Dr. Pausch
    discusses using post-its and other manual tools that have now been
    replaced by applications for note taking on laptops, smartphones,
    and tablets. Pause to take notes as needed.

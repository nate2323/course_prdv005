**Unit 2: Overcoming Procrastination and Learning to Delegate** <span
id="2"></span> 
*When you are focused on something that does not reflect one of your
determined priorities, you are procrastinating. In order to overcome
procrastination, you must first be aware that it is happening. Unit 2
will give you the steps to manage and resolve this self-created time
waster, which minimizes your productivity and creates stress. Another
effective time-prioritizing technique is to identify those tasks in your
life that can be delegated to others. Many of us are guilty of trying to
do everything on our own. However, there are a number of time-management
benefits to you, the person to whom you delegate your tasks, and the
organization as a whole, when you learn to properly delegate.*
